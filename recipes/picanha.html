        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <hl>
            <li>3 to 4 pounds picanha beef (top sirloin cap)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>High heat oil, for greasing the grill</li>
        </hl>

        <h2>Steps to make it</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat grill to high (about 400°F). Score the fat cap of your Brazilian steak in a crosshatch pattern. Do not cut too deeply – you want to stay within the fat.</li>
                <li>Season the fat cap of the steak, reserving 1 tsp. of the seasoning, and pat it down so it sticks well to the beef.</li>
                <li>Cut your picanha steak into 1-inch strips. Fold each strip into a “C” shape and slide onto metal skewers. Season with the reserved seasoning directly on the beef.</li>
